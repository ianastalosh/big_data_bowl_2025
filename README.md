# Setup instructions
I ran the following commands to setup Poetry in the repo, as per consultation with Claude and the [link here.](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

Install poetry: `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -`
Add to path: `export PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"`
Create a poetry environment: `poetry init`
Set `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true`
